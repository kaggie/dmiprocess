# This file is intended for small, self-contained utility functions
# that can be reused across different modules of the application.
#
# Examples could include:
# - Parsing functions (e.g., string to list of numbers)
# - Specific data validation functions (if very generic)
# - Simple formatting utilities
#
# For now, it will be populated if such functions are identified during the scan.
